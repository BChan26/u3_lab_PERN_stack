For this lab, lets take our Back End skills in Sequelize and Express and combine them with our React front end to create a full stack application using our relational databases

Start by creating a database in Sequelize and attach it to our Express server. Make sure to install and use CORS and all necessary middleware. Your Database should have at least 3 related models. Test your routes and controllers in Insomnia and load them up on localhost:3001.

You can use Postico, your SQL shell, or 

Once you have these routes created, set up a React front end and using Axios, pull and render your data.

### Requirements 
- A Sequelize Database attached to an Express server with at least 3 related models and routes
- Full CRUD with at least one of your models on the back end
- A connected React front end that Gets your data and renders to your screen
- At least 3 routes in your front end, with a landing page, and others to pull and show your data


### Bonus

- Try to use Axios's Post, Put, and Delete methods to give your front end app Full CRUD, creating your first Full CRUD, Full Stack app. 
- Use your dynamic endpoints (/:id) to have both Index and Show routes for your data.
